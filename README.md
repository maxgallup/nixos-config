### Connected Drives

There are three different drives connected each serving a different purpose:
* `/mnt/hdd-500g` - Random unused drive
* `/mnt/hdd-6t` - currently contains old backups TODO: make this the backup drive
* `/mnt/ssd-2t` - holds mount points for the library and database of the immich docker container
